## goals
1. project synergies

* list g-spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QjUiZI9q8mRGHMt5yfDi_O1bPoWo54_pyI1gPEWGtXE/edit?usp=sharing).

## introductions
* Joseph: new sat [HYPSO](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/h/hypso) 1: hyperspectral 400-800nm. good for chl. since mid-feb. doing calibration. targeted ~50m res
* Gabrielle: 3m hyperspectral IR. also SAR data. PyGMI good for band raitos & data srcing.
* Helia: teaches software eng & programming & data mining. 
* Joao: storage solutions, web servers, processing for AIR center.
    * added sensors to bouys to avoid lost fishing gear becoming "ghost nets"
        * could add sensors to line or nets using sonar
    * DRS does local processing b/c bandwidth not sufficient to send to the cloud directly
* Analysis-Ready Data (ARD) term from digital earth africa+australia - PCI Geomatico (from Canada)
    * may be difficult to get the data there
